<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Tharun Potla, 
  a passionate and dedicated web developer with a keen interest 
  in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. With a solid
   foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies,
    I strive to build seamless and efficient web applications
     that enhance user experience and meet client needs.

<p>With 5 years of experience in the web development field, I have 
  honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and
   frameworks. My expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
   and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development.
    On the back end, I am proficient in Node.js, Express, Python (Django/Flask),
     and PHP, among others. This diverse skill set allows me to tackle
      a wide range of projects, from single-page applications to complex e-commerce platforms.

<p>Outside of coding, I have a passion for continuous learning
   and keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends 
   and technologies. I often participate in hackathons and
    coding challenges, which not only sharpen my skills but
     also fuel my creativity and problem-solving abilities.
      In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source 
      projects and sharing my knowledge with the community 
      through blog posts and tutorials.
